<h1> About Me</h1>

<p> <img src="images/baby.jpeg" alt="Baby photo" class="babyphoto">
Hello! My name is Malachi, and I’m a young aspiring developer. </p>
<p>
My interests in IT and Computer Science stemmed from a young age. Growing up in a household with 2 parents who are both technologically gifted and have quite 'digital' jobs, I look up to them, and have always been fascinated in electronics. In addition, as I’ve grown up playing a lot of digital games such as Fifa, I’ve always been interested in the science behind the games, and how they were created, or developed.</p>
<p>
My interests in IT continued throughout secondary school as I picked the subject as one of my optional subjects (alongside PE and History) for my GCSEs. Below is what I scored in each of my subjects:
</p>
<table id="resultstbl">
    <tr> 
        <th>Subject</th>
        <th> Grade achieved</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Information Technologies</td>
        <td> Distinction 2 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Combined Science</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> English Language</td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>English Literature</td>
    <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>History</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mathematics</td>
        <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Physical Education</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Spanish</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p> 
 I also sat English and Spanish speaking exams in which I attained a Merit in English (on a pass/merit/distinction scale) and a distinction in Spanish, on the same basis.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am studying for my A-Levels, and am due to sit exams in History, Maths and IT in May 2023.
</p>
<p> 
 Besides education, I enjoy exploring new things, watching different sports, and as previously mentioned, playing games (and I'm very good at games). I also have recently started to enjoy coding. My first experience in coding was during the summer holiday of 2022. I attended a 20 hour, 5 day course with <a href="https://ladderbackdown.com/"> The Ladder Back Down</a>. The instructor taught me HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.</p>
 
 <p>I have not built on my JavaScript skills as of now, but have continued learning HTML and CSS through firstly using YouTube tutorials for beginners, and also making a practice website with the help of one of my brothers and my uncle, who has years of experience. With skills aquired from all of these sources, I have started to build my own independent website. 
 </p>
 <p> Whilst maintaining this website, I am also working towards builing a more advanced website, including the use of Bootstrap. This, alongside all the other websites I have built/am building, can be viewed on My Github or Codepen, as presented at the top of the screen.</p>
 <p>
    In addition to participating in the 5 day course with Ladder Back Down, during the 2022 summer holidays, I also did my work experience at Schroders, an asset management company. I worked across 2 branches, one in Horsham (which was a very long journey on a very busy train) and the other on London Wall Street.
</p>
    <p>
    I spent time within different roles at the company, including business roles as well as IT development roles. This was an experience unique to any other, and I enjoyed meeting different people and teams and being introduced to varying parts of their roles, verbally and with practical demonstrations.</p>
<p>
 Meeting various staff was very benefitial, as I met a few people who were on apprenticeship schemes, and some who had worked their way up from apprenticeship schemes, and they were able to give me a sense of direction in where to start from. 
 </p>
 <p>
    Not only did this work experience help me increase my knowledge, it also helped me get used to simple work principles such as punctuality, my attendance (which is 100% in school to this day) and generally the values of working within a coorporate organisation.
