About me page
  <p> Hello. My name is Malachi, and I am a young aspiring developer. My interests in IT and Computer Science both stemed from a young age. Growing up in a household with 2 parents who were both technologically gifted and had quite 'digital' jobs, I also looked up to them, and have always been fascinated to electronics.
